# HW12.employeeTracker

For this homework assignment we were to create a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to add departments, roles and employees.  Along with adding, the user should be able to view each of the above and update the employee roles.  Through the process of creating this command-line application, I used the MySQL NPM package and InquirerJs NPM package.I was not able to complete every step of this assignment and I am continueing to work on this.  

## Acceptable Criteria
```
Functional application.


GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing the project.


The command-line application should allow users to:


Add departments, roles, employees


View departments, roles, employees


Update employee roles
```

## What I accomplished

I was able to accomplish most of the acceptable criteria.  I was able to view all departments, roles, and employees.  I was also able to add employee to an extent.  I was also able to add departments.  I was not able to completely add employees and was not able to add roles and update employee roles.  I am continueing to work on each of the following not completed.  I am trying to use a similar function used for creating the departments for creating the roles and employees.  Below is an example of the application and what works and what does not:
